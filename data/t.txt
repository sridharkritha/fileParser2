Betfair forecast prices are expressed as decimals. For example, 3.25 is equivalent to 9/4 in traditional fractional odds. These forecast prices reflect an approximate 100% book as is typical of Betfair markets. They differ from a normal SP forecast as, unlike SPs, they do not include a bookmaker "overround" percentage.

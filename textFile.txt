FLIGHTY FILIA has finished a close second on her first two attempts at 2m, including over C&D, and this lightly raced 4yo can deservedly break her duck in first-time blinkers. Maison Brillet didn't enjoy the best of runs on last month's return at Lingfield and this three-time course winner is feared most, ahead of Guards Chapel and Shalambar.[Ben Hutton]

O'CONNOR'S GIRL improved for the step up to 1m2f at Lingfield on Tuesday and this half-sister to talented stayer Buckland should be suited by another couple of furlongs today. She gets the nod ahead of David Simcock's newcomer Playful Dude, who cost 82,000USD as a yearling. Jazzy has shown decent form but needs to prove his stamina for this new trip.[Ben Hutton]
